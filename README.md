## What exactly does it do?

ELGamed Auto Runes scraps [U.GG](https://u.gg/) for the champion that you've selected during champion selection. Then, it utilizes the [LCU-Sharp](https://github.com/bryanhitc/lcu-sharp) library to access the client, providing you with the option to choose between the two most common runes and summoner spells for that champion.

## Contributions

This is a personal project intended for simple use. I created it because I wanted a lightweight application to import runes for myself and assist my friends who are new to League of Legends. I plan to add more features to enhance this application. Any effort to improve this app is appreciated, and if you encounter any bugs, please don't hesitate to report them by creating an issue.

## IMPORTANT NOTE AFTER CLONING

If you've cloned the project, ensure to copy the "data" folder and paste it alongside the executable within the "\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows" directory.
